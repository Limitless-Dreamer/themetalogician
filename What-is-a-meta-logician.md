What is a Meta Logician ?
- It comes from the word Buddha.
- Buddha means buddhi + dhadha i.e. intellect/logic + beyond/meta. Therefore it means beyond intellect or meta-logic.
- And applying that to a person means Meta-Logician.
- Now I am not a Complete and Right Buddha, but I am a Once-Returner. And I have given the site the name while thinking about the future.

- I want every reader who reads this site or watches my youtube videos to one day reach buddhahood i.e. become a Meta-Logician.
- I am only offering my services.
