In Buddhism, happiness is understood in layers—some fleeting, some deep, some unshakable. The tradition often speaks less about “happiness” as pleasure and more about well-being, contentment, and freedom from non satisfaction (dukkha). Here are the main types:

-----------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------

**1. Worldly Happiness (āmisa-sukha)**

Comes from sense pleasures: good food, music, comfort, relationships, wealth.

Real but temporary—it fades, changes, or can lead to craving and attachment.

Example: the joy of tasting your favorite sweet.

--------------------

**2. Happiness of Renunciation (nekkhamma-sukha)**

Found by letting go of craving rather than indulging it.

A lighter, more spacious joy—freedom from the burden of clinging.

Example: the peace you feel when you stop chasing after something and realize you don’t actually need it.

-------------------------

**3. Happiness of Concentration (samādhi-sukha)**

The bliss of meditation (jhāna states).

Deep calm and joy from a unified, concentrated mind.

Not dependent on external things.

Example: a serene inner glow when your mind settles and becomes still.

----------------------

**4. Happiness of Insight (vipassanā-sukha)**

Joy from seeing truth clearly: impermanence, non-self, and the end of craving.

Brings clarity, release, and lightness of heart.

Example: the freedom when you deeply realize “I don’t have to hold on.”

-------------------------

**5. Supreme Happiness (nibbāna-sukha)**

The unconditioned happiness of awakening, complete freedom from non satisfaction.

Beyond pleasure and pain—peace that cannot be shaken.

Called the highest bliss in the texts: “Nibbānaṃ paramaṃ sukhaṃ.”

✨ So in short:
**
Pleasure → sense-based, fades.

Renunciation → joy of letting go.

Concentration → bliss of meditation.

Insight → happiness of wisdom.

Nibbāna → ultimate, unshakable peace.**
