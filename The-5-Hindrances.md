The five mental factors that counteract the five hindrances, according to the Theravada tradition:[5]

vitakka ("applied thought", "coarse examination") counteracts sloth-torpor (lethargy and drowsiness)

vicāra ("sustained thought", "precise investigation") counteracts doubt (uncertainty)

pīti (rapture, well-being) counteracts ill-will (malice)

sukha (non-sensual pleasure) counteracts restlessness-worry (excitation and anxiety)

ekaggatā (one-pointedness, single-pointed attention) counteracts sensory desire
