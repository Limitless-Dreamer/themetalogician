Ah, you’ve touched into **vedanānupassanā** (contemplation of feelings/stimuli) from the **Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta** 🌿

When the sutta says _worldly (sāmisa)_ and _unworldly (nirāmisa)_ feelings, it means this:

---

### **Worldly feelings (sāmisa-vedanā)**

- Feelings tied up with the **five senses** and conditioned by ordinary experiences.
    
- “With bait” → the Buddha used this word literally like “flesh-baited” — they’re attractive but entangled.
    
- Examples:
    
    - Pleasant: the taste of delicious food, hearing a nice song.
        
    - Painful: stubbing your toe, being insulted.
        
    - Neutral: sitting quietly and not noticing much sensation.
        

---

### **Unworldly feelings (nirāmisa-vedanā)**

- Feelings not tied to sense-pleasures, but arising from **spiritual practice, letting go, or insight**.
    
- “Without bait” → not conditioned by craving.
    
- Examples:
    
    - Pleasant: joy from meditation, peace from renunciation, relief when craving fades.
        
    - Painful: discomfort when seeing the danger in samsāra, the sting of recognizing attachment.
        
    - Neutral: equanimity in deep meditation, balanced awareness beyond attraction or repulsion.

### Why the Buddha makes this distinction

- **Worldly** feelings tend to feed craving and clinging.
    
- **Unworldly** feelings can support detachment and wisdom.
    

When practicing _vedanānupassanā_, you don’t just note “pleasant, painful, neutral” — you also notice **what kind of pleasant (or painful) it is**:

- Is it tied to craving and the world (sāmisa)?
    
- Or is it rooted in renunciation, peace, insight (nirāmisa)?
    

---

🌸 In essence:

- **Worldly feelings** = sense-based, baited by craving.
    
- **Unworldly feelings** = spiritual, unbaited, leading toward freedom.

Pain rooted in sense-experience or worldly loss.

- Toothache, backache, physical sickness.
    
- Sadness from rejection or losing money.
    
- Anguish when a relationship ends.

## **4. Painful Unworldly Feeling (nirāmisa-dukkha-vedanā)**

Spiritual discomfort that leads toward wisdom.

- The sting of seeing one’s own attachment.
    
- The unease when realizing impermanence deeply.

## **5. Neutral Worldly Feeling (sāmisa-adukkhamasukha-vedanā)**

Bland, unnoticed, or indifferent feelings in ordinary life.

- Sitting without much sensation.
    
- Walking without noticing the body.
    
- Mind drifting in a dull, neutral state.

## **6. Neutral Unworldly Feeling (nirāmisa-adukkhamasukha-vedanā)**

Equanimity rooted in meditation and wisdom.

- Calm balance in mindfulness, without reacting.
    
- Deep equanimity in the fourth jhāna.
