The **Six Sense Bases (saḷāyatana)** are a central part of the Buddha’s teaching. They show how our entire world of experience arises.

## 1. The Six Internal Sense Bases

These are the six “doors” through which experience comes:

1. **Eye (cakkhu)** – the physical organ of sight
    
2. **Ear (sota)** – the organ of hearing
    
3. **Nose (ghāna)** – the organ of smell
    
4. **Tongue (jivhā)** – the organ of taste
    
5. **Body (kāya)** – the organ of touch
    
6. **Mind (mano)** – the mental organ, which receives thoughts, memories, ideas, images

## 2. The Six External Sense Bases

Each internal base meets its external object:

1. **Visible forms (rūpa)** – colors, shapes, light
    
2. **Sounds (sadda)**
    
3. **Odors (gandha)**
    
4. **Tastes (rasa)**
    
5. **Tactile objects (phoṭṭhabba)** – hardness, softness, hot, cold, rough, smooth, etc.
    
6. **Mental objects (dhammā)** – thoughts, feelings, memories, plans, concepts

## 3. How Experience Arises

- When **internal base** + **external object** + **consciousness** meet, there is **contact (phassa)**.
    
- Contact gives rise to **feeling (vedanā)** (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral).
    
- From feeling → craving → clinging → becoming … (dependent origination).
    

So, the Six Sense Bases are the **arena** where dependent origination plays out moment to moment.

## 4. Key Insights from the Six Sense Bases

1. **The world is within the senses**: everything you call “world” is just sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and mental images.
    
2. **They are conditioned and impermanent**: none of the six bases are stable or in your control.
    
3. **Not-self**: there is no permanent “seer” or “thinker” beyond the bases; just the process of sense activity.
    
4. **Freedom comes from mindfulness at the sense-door**: by seeing sights as just sights, sounds as just sounds, thoughts as just thoughts, craving doesn’t arise.

🌿 In the **Satipaṭṭhāna (mindfulness practice)**, mindfulness of the six senses helps cut craving at its root, because you learn to observe contact and feeling _without grasping_.
