     [How to spot cravings](How-to-spot-cravings.md)
     1. Craving - Sensory Desire
     2. Craving - Becoming
     3. Craving - Non Becoming

2. DELETE
      - Nirvana = to blow out, to be unbound, to become limitless, liberation

     - Dissolving is not the right way, liberation is. 
     - If everyone is the same, then how can there be love.
     - The difference between people makes love beautiful.

     - Liberation is when Experience lets go of the 6 clinging sense-experiences and the 5 clinging aggregates 

3. PATH

   - CLARITY
     1. RIGHT VIEW

         - The three marks of existence
         
             - Non-Permanence ( Reality is non-permanent, just a stream of processes.)
             
             - Non-Satisfaction (Everything is conditioned, therefore everything is non-                                         satisfactory.)
             
             - Non-Self (There is a self but not a permanent one, it changes from moment to                    moment, it a stream of processess.)
