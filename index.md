# CREATION = CHAOS + RIGHT ORDER

What is Right Order ?
- The Order that is in line with The Four Noble Truths is the Right Order.
- Right Order leads to Balance & Harmony, whereas Wrong Order only leads back to Chaos.
- Order is done while Balance simply is.

## THE SYSTEM OF THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS
--------------
--------------
### **1. NON-SATISFACTION**

   - Non-Satisfaction of non-satisfaction (non-satisfaction due to mental and physical things)

### **3. DELETE**      

- Nirvana = to blow out, to be unbound, to become limitless, liberation

     - Dissolving is not the right way, liberation is.
 
     - If everyone is the same, then how can there be love.
       
     - The difference between people makes love beautiful.

     - Liberation is when Experience lets go of the 6 clinging sense-experiences and the 5 clinging aggregates
