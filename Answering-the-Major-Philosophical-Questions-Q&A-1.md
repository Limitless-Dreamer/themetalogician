# Answering the Major Philosophical Questions Q&A-1

### **1. Existence and Reality**

- What is the meaning of life?
     - The meaning of life is to be satisficed(happy) and make others satisficed(happy).
       
------------
- Does God exist?
     - It doesn't matter if god /gods exist or not, you should focus on your practice ( The 10 fold path ).
 ------------  
- What is reality? How do we know what’s real?
     - Reality is what you experience through your 6 sense organs ( Eyes, Ears, Nose, Tongue, Body and Mind ). 
     
     - There is no only objective reality or only subjective reality, reality is both objective and subjective.
     
     - Reality changes when you observe it ( Quantum Mechanics ).
       
---------------------

- Are we free, or is everything determined?
     - Freedom coexists with causality.
     
     - The more you are bound in the 3 unwholesome roots of temptation, repulsion and delusion the more your reality is determined. Your future can be determined through calculation.
     
     - The more you reduce the the 3 unwholesome roots and cultivate the the 3 wholesome roots i.e. Satisfaction, Loving-Kindness, Clarity the more ==Free Will== you will have. Your future cannot be determined through calculation.

- Do we have a soul?
     - No you don't have a permanent soul. You are just a bunch of processes working together to create a self i.e. The Five Clinging Aggregates.

          - What transfers from life to life ?
             - In **Buddhism**, nothing permanent—no soul or self—transfers from life to life. But **something does continue**, and it’s often described carefully:

1. **Karma (actions) and karmic results:**  ( Action-Experience )
    
    - Your intentions, thoughts, and actions leave **imprints or seeds**.
        
    - These karmic seeds shape your next life—your tendencies, circumstances, and experiences.
        
    - It’s not a “thing” that moves; it’s a **causal continuity**.
        
2. **Habitual patterns (samskaras / habits and heuristics):**
    
    - Your learned habits, inclinations, and mental tendencies influence how you **experience the next life**.
        
    - Like a flame lighting another flame: it’s continuous causation, not a fixed entity.
        
3. **Stream of consciousness / experience:**
    
    - Awareness(Experience) flows moment to moment. At death, **the momentum of that stream continues**, conditioned by karma.
        
    - But there is no permanent experiencer or soul that moves with it—just a continuity of conditioned processes.
        

**Analogy often used:**  
Think of **a wave on the ocean**. The wave ends, but the energy continues in the water and forms the next wave. There’s continuity without a fixed self.
