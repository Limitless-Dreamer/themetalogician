NON-SATISFACTION

   - Non-Satisfaction of non-satisfaction (non-satisfaction due to mental and physical things)
   
   - Non-Satisfaction of change (non-satisfaction due to the non-permanent nature of satisfactory things, also called non-satisfaction of satisfaction)
   
   - Non-Satisfaction of habits (- All conditioned phenomena (body, mind, world) are unstable, not-self, and ultimately unsatisfactory. Even when there is no obvious pain or loss, the very fact that everything is **impermanent and dependently arisen** makes it unreliable.) ==Non-Satisfaction due to clinging to the non-permanent FIVE AGGREGATES.==
   
   -  The Eight Everyday Forms of Non-Satisfaction

     In some discourses, the Buddha listed **eight specific sufferings**:

       1. Birth is suffering.
    
       2. Aging is suffering.
    
       3. Sickness is suffering.
    
       4. Death is suffering.
    
       5. Separation from what we love is suffering.
    
       6. Association with what we dislike is suffering.
    
       7. Not getting what we want is suffering.
    
       8. In short, clinging to the five aggregates is suffering.

- Root Cause of Non-Satisfaction

    - All these kinds of unsatisfaction arise from **craving (taṇhā)** and    **clinging (upādāna)**.
    
    - When we crave permanence, pleasure, or self-identity in a world that is impermanent, unstable, and not-self → non-satisfaction inevitably arises.

✨ In summary:

   - **Gross non-satisfaction**: pain, grief, sickness, obvious hardships.
    
   - **Subtle non-satisfaction**: loss of pleasure due to change.
    
   - **Deepest non-satisfaction**: the conditioned nature of all things, which makes them ultimately unreliable.
