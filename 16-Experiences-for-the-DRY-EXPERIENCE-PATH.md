The 16 Insight Knowledges (Ñāṇas) / The 16 experiences for the dry-awareness path

------

Stage 1: Knowledge of Mental & Physical Phenomena (Nāma-rūpa-pariccheda-ñāṇa)

The meditator begins to clearly distinguish body (rūpa) from mind (nāma).

Example: Noticing “lifting” is physical, but the knowing of it is mental.

This breaks the illusion of a single self.

-----

Stage 2: Knowledge of Cause and Effect (Paccaya-pariggaha-ñāṇa)

One sees how intentions cause actions, and how sense-contact leads to feeling.

Example: “Because I see an object, the mind reacts with liking/disliking.”

Insight into dependent origination begins.

-----


Stage 3: Knowledge of Comprehension (Sammasana-ñāṇa)

The meditator reflects on the Three Marks (anicca, dukkha, anattā) in all phenomena.

This stage can feel intellectual at first, but it deepens into experience.

-----

Stage 4: Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away (Udayabbaya-ñāṇa)

Very clear, sharp mindfulness: phenomena are seen arising and vanishing rapidly.

Mind becomes bright, sometimes with rapture, visions, light, bliss.

This is the “peak” of meditation joy before deeper disillusionment.

-----


Stage 5: Knowledge of Dissolution (Bhanga-ñāṇa)

The meditator sees only dissolution: all phenomena break up, nothing endures.

Pleasant visions fade; everything seems unstable, disintegrating.

Can feel dark, empty, but it’s profound insight.

-----


Stage 6: Knowledge of Fear (Bhaya-ñāṇa)

Seeing constant dissolution, the meditator feels fear: nothing is reliable.

Example: “This body, these thoughts — they’re all crumbling.”


-----

Stage 7: Knowledge of Misery (Ādīnava-ñāṇa)

Seeing danger in phenomena: there’s no safety in clinging.

Everything experienced feels unsatisfactory, almost painful.

-----

Stage 8: Knowledge of Disgust (Nibbidā-ñāṇa)

Strong turning away from all conditioned things.

Example: Meditation feels boring, repulsive, “Why bother with these fleeting things?”

-----

Stage 9: Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance (Muñcitukamyatā-ñāṇa)

A deep longing arises: “I want to be free of this entire unsatisfactory process.”

The heart cries for liberation.

-----

Stage 10: Knowledge of Re-observation (Paṭisaṅkhā-ñāṇa)

Intense investigation: the mind applies effort strongly, reviewing all phenomena.

This is usually the most difficult stage (restlessness, doubt, despair may peak).

Feels like a great inner battle.

-----

Stage 11: Knowledge of Equanimity about Formations (Saṅkhārupekkhā-ñāṇa)

Balance arises: the meditator accepts phenomena without fear, craving, or aversion.

Experiences are seen calmly, steadily, without preference.

This is a beautiful, spacious, serene stage.

-----

Stage 12: Knowledge of Conformity (Anuloma-ñāṇa)

Insight reaches perfect harmony with the truth.

==The mind aligns with dependent origination and four noble truths.==

It’s like everything fits into place.

-----

Stage 13: Knowledge of Change-of-Lineage (Gotrabhū-ñāṇa)

The meditator shifts from the “worldling lineage” (puthujjana) to the “noble lineage” (ariya).

This is the threshold moment before Nibbāna.

-----

Stage 14: Knowledge of Path (Magga-ñāṇa)

Direct realization of Nibbāna, unconditioned reality.

The mind cuts through defilements corresponding to the stage of awakening (stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arahant).

-----

Stage 15: Knowledge of Fruition (Phala-ñāṇa)

After the Path moment, Fruition follows: abiding in the peace of Nibbāna.

The meditator rests in the coolness of release.

-----

Stage 16: Knowledge of Reviewing (Paccavekkhaṇa-ñāṇa)

Looking back: reviewing the defilements abandoned, the truth realized, and what remains.

Confirms what stage of enlightenment has been reached.

-----


How They Progress

These 16 ñāṇas are sequential: each one naturally unfolds into the next.

In dry insight (without absorption-jhāna), progress depends on continuous noting / observation with momentary samādhi.

Breakthroughs (stream-entry → arahantship) require cycling through these ñāṇas again and again, each time deeper, until all defilements are cut.

✨ In short:
The 16 ñāṇas are a map of awakening. They guide a meditator through joy, fear, disgust, balance, and finally liberation. The path is cyclical — one revisits these knowledges at deeper levels until full arahantship.

List of the sixteen nanas of dry insight/awareness path as summary.


In the dry insight path (sukkha-vipassanā), one develops only insight (vipassanā) without relying on deep absorption jhānas. The progress unfolds through sixteen ñāṇas (knowledges of insight), step by step:

The Sixteen Insight Knowledges (Vipassanā-ñāṇas)
Stage 1: Preliminary Knowledge

Nāmarūpa-pariccheda-ñāṇa – Knowledge of distinguishing mentality and materiality (name-and-form).

Paccaya-pariggaha-ñāṇa – Knowledge of discerning conditions (causes and effects).

Sammasana-ñāṇa – Knowledge of comprehension through the three characteristics (impermanence, non-satisfaction, not-self).

Stage 2: Deeper Insight into Characteristics
4. Udayabbaya-ñāṇa – Knowledge of arising and passing away (seeing things come and go very clearly).
5. Bhanga-ñāṇa – Knowledge of dissolution (seeing only passing away, breaking up of phenomena).

Stage 3: Danger, Fear, and Disenchantment
6. Bhaya-ñāṇa – Knowledge of fearfulness (existence is fearful because it is unstable).
7. Ādīnava-ñāṇa – Knowledge of danger or disadvantage (seeing suffering inherent in phenomena).
8. Nibbidā-ñāṇa – Knowledge of disenchantment (deep weariness with conditioned existence).

Stage 4: Turning Away and Desire for Freedom
9. Muñcitukamyatā-ñāṇa – Knowledge of desire for deliverance (longing to escape samsara).
10. Paṭisaṅkhā-ñāṇa – Knowledge of reflection (making effort to find the way out).
11. Saṅkhārupekkhā-ñāṇa – Knowledge of equanimity about formations (deep balance, neutrality toward arising and passing).

Stage 5: Nearing the Goal
12. Anuloma-ñāṇa – Knowledge of conformity (mind aligns with the path, preparing for breakthrough).
13. Gotrabhū-ñāṇa – Knowledge of change-of-lineage (shifting from ordinary being to noble disciple).
14. Magga-ñāṇa – Path knowledge (direct penetration of Nibbāna).
15. Phala-ñāṇa – Fruition knowledge (experiencing the fruit of the path, Nibbāna’s peace).
16. Paccavekkhaṇa-ñāṇa – Knowledge of reviewing (looking back at what has been attained).

✨ These sixteen ñāṇas are the map of insight practice, whether one practices with jhāna or dry insight. In dry insight, the mind uses momentary concentration (khaṇika samādhi) rather than deep absorption.
