“Samādhi” in Buddhism simply means **collectedness, unification of mind**. But the texts talk about it in many types and levels depending on context. Let me organize them for you:

---

## 1. **By Depth/Strength of Concentration**

- **Momentary concentration (khaṇika-samādhi)** – the mind becomes one-pointed for a short time, used in vipassanā (insight practice).
    
- **Access concentration (upacāra-samādhi)** – stable concentration right before absorption, hindrances are suppressed but not fully gone.
    
- **Absorption concentration (appanā-samādhi)** – deep unification of mind in the jhānas, completely beyond the hindrances.

## 2. **By Wholesomeness**

- **Right concentration (sammā samādhi)** – concentration rooted in the path, supported by ethics and right view, leads to wisdom.
    
- **Wrong concentration (micchā samādhi)** – concentration developed with craving, wrong view, or for unwholesome purposes (e.g., sorcery, manipulation).

## 3. **By Meditative Objects**

- **Jhāna samādhi** – concentration based on calm meditation objects (breath, kasinas, mettā, etc.), leading into the four form jhānas and the four formless attainments.
    
- **Vipassanā samādhi** – insight-concentration, stabilizing the mind to see impermanence, non-self, and unsatisfactoriness clearly.
    
- **Mixed samādhi (samatha-vipassanā yuganaddha)** – when calm and insight are yoked together in balance.

## 4. **By Scope of Experience**

- **Form-sphere concentration (rūpāvacara samādhi)** – the four jhānas.
    
- **Formless-sphere concentration (arūpāvacara samādhi)** – the four formless attainments:
    
    1. Infinite space
        
    2. Infinite consciousness
        
    3. Nothingness
        
    4. Neither perception nor non-perception

## 5. **By Liberation-Orientation**

- **Temporary liberation of mind (tadaṅga vimutti)** – momentary freedom when wholesome states suppress defilements.
    
- **Liberation by suppression (vikkhambhana samādhi)** – concentration strong enough to hold back hindrances (like in access or jhāna).
    
- **Final liberation (samuccheda samādhi)** – concentration supporting wisdom that uproots defilements permanently.

✨ So in short:

- By strength → momentary, access, absorption.
    
- By morality → right, wrong.
    
- By method → jhāna, vipassanā, mixed.
    
- By sphere → form, formless.
    
- By liberation → temporary, suppressive, final.
