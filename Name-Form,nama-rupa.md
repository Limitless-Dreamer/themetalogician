In **Buddhism**, **Name-and-Form (nāma-rūpa)** is a key concept in the **dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda)** framework. It explains how **mind and body interact 
to create the sense of a living being**. Let’s break it down carefully.

### **1. Meaning of the terms**

- **Nāma (Name / Mental Factors):**  
    Refers to the **mental aspects of experience**, including:
    
    1. Feeling / sensation (vedanā)
        
    2. Perception / recognition (saññā)
        
    3. Intention / volition (cetanā)
        
    4. Contact (phassa)
        
    5. Attention / attention focus (manasikāra)  
        Essentially, **the “mind” side of experience**.
        
- **Rūpa (Form / Materiality):**  
    Refers to the **physical body and material phenomena**, including:
    
    - The four great elements (earth, water, fire, air)
        
    - Sense organs and physical form  
        Essentially, **the “body” side of experience**.

### **2. Dependent Origination Context**

In the twelve links of dependent origination, **nāma-rūpa arises dependent on consciousness (viññāṇa)**:

- **Consciousness(Experience) + conditions → Name-and-Form:**
    
    - Consciousness (awareness of experiences) depends on **previous karmic conditions**.
        
    - In turn, consciousness conditions **the arising of mind-and-body (nāma-rūpa)**, which allows a being to experience the world.
        
- **Mutual dependence:**
    
    - Nāma-rūpa and consciousness(experience) are said to be in a **reciprocal relationship**:
        
        - Consciousness(experience) requires a body and mental faculties to function.
            
        - The body and mental factors exist because consciousness(experience) is present to “inhabit” them.

### **3. Function / Significance**

- **Creation of individual experience:**
    
    - Nāma-rūpa is what gives rise to a **living, sentient being capable of perception(labeling) and action**.
        
- **Bridge between mind and body:**
    
    - Explains how physical and mental phenomena interact.
        
- **Impermanent and conditioned:**
    
    - Both name and form are **subject to change**, reinforcing the Buddhist principle of **anattā (not-self)**.

### **4. Analogy**

- Think of **nāma-rūpa as a smartphone**:
    
    - **Rūpa (form)** = the hardware, the physical body.
        
    - **Nāma (name/mental factors)** = the software, the programs that allow it to function and interact.
        
    - Both are necessary; neither alone can operate as a “phone,” and both are impermanent and dependent on conditions.

In short:  
**Nāma-rūpa = the combination of mental and physical factors that constitute a living being, arising dependently on consciousness(experience), and fully impermanent and conditioned.**
