Explain all parts of vigyanaya / Experiences



Let’s unfold **Vijñānavāda / Yogācāra’s Vijñāna model** (often translated as _Consciousness-only_ school), which describes reality in terms of different layers of _vijñāna_ (experience/awareness).

Buddhism here divides **vijñāna** into _eight parts_, each playing a role in how we perceive, cling, and liberate:

---

### **1. Six Sense-Consciousnesses (ṣaḍvijñāna)**

These are the ordinary experiences tied to the six sense doors:

1. **Cakṣur-vijñāna** – visual experience (eye-consciousness)
    
2. **Śrotra-vijñāna** – auditory experience (ear-consciousness)
    
3. **Ghrāṇa-vijñāna** – olfactory experience (nose-consciousness)
    
4. **Jihvā-vijñāna** – gustatory experience (tongue-consciousness)
    
5. **Kāya-vijñāna** – tactile experience (body-consciousness, touch/temperature/pressure)
    
6. **Mano-vijñāna** – mental experience (thoughts, concepts, imagination, reasoning)
    

👉 These six are momentary, arising with contact (sparśa) and dependent on sense organ + sense object.

### **2. Kliṣṭa-manas (the 7th consciousness)**

- Also called **defiled mind**.
    
- Constantly clings to the idea of “I” and “mine.”
    
- It is ego-centered, attaching to the flow of experience as “self.”
    
- Generates pride, ignorance, and delusion.
    
- Example: instead of just _seeing a tree_, it immediately tags it as _“my tree, my world, my life.”_

### **3. Ālaya-vijñāna (the 8th consciousness, Storehouse)**

- Literally “abode” or “storehouse consciousness.”
    
- A deep layer of experience that stores **all karmic seeds (bīja)**.
    
- It is the “unconscious foundation” where impressions of past actions are preserved.
    
- These seeds ripen into future experiences, shaping rebirth, perception, and habits.
    
- Liberation requires purifying the ālaya so that no karmic seeds remain.

### **The Transformations (Pariṇāma of Vijñāna)**

Vijñāna isn’t static. Yogācāra says consciousness goes through **four transformations**:

1. **Vipāka-vijñāna** – ripening of karmic seeds stored in ālaya.
    
2. **Manas-vijñāna** – ego-centered reflection (_this is me, mine_).
    
3. **Pravṛtti-vijñāna** – active functioning through the six senses.
    
4. **Āśraya-parāvṛtti** – the great turning (transformation of the basis = liberation), when ālaya is purified and Buddhahood arises.

🌼 **Summary**:

- **6 consciousnesses** = sensory + mental experiences
    
- **7th (manas/ ahamkara)** = ego-making, clinging “I-maker”
    
- **8th (ālaya)** = storehouse of karmic seeds
    
- **Liberation** = transforming the entire vijñāna stream until no ego or seeds remain → pure awareness/experience without duality.

### **Buddhist Path Connection**

- **Ignorant mind:** Citta is constantly stirred by seeds of greed, hatred, delusion.
    
- **Practice:** Through meditation and wisdom, wholesome seeds are planted in ālaya.
    
- **Liberation:** At awakening, ālaya-vijñāna itself is transformed — no longer a karmic storehouse, but pure awareness (_amalavijñāna_, “stainless consciousness”).
