Right resolve (also called **Right Intention** or _Sammā Saṅkappa_) is the **second step of the Noble Eightfold Path**, following Right View.

It’s about the **inner orientation of the mind** — the kind of purpose, motivation, or resolve that directs how we think, speak, and act.

According to the Buddha, Right Resolve has **three aspects**:

---

### 1. **Resolve of Renunciation (Nekkhamma-saṅkappa)**

- Turning away from craving, clinging, and sensual desire.
    
- Not suppression, but a shift of heart: seeing that true happiness does not come from endless grasping.
    
- Example: instead of chasing wealth just for luxury, one may use it wisely and focus on inner growth.
    

---

### 2. **Resolve of Non-Ill Will (Abyāpāda-saṅkappa)**

- Cultivating thoughts of **goodwill and loving-kindness** (_mettā_).
    
- Replacing hostility, resentment, or irritation with a sincere wish for others to be well.
    
- Example: instead of reacting to an enemy with hatred, training the mind to respond with compassion.

### 3. **Resolve of Non-Cruelty (Avihiṁsā-saṅkappa)**

- Rooted in **compassion (karuṇā)**.
    
- Letting go of the tendency to harm, exploit, or use others.
    
- Example: caring for beings instead of ignoring their suffering.

### Essence of Right Resolve

It’s about aligning the **heart’s compass**. While Right View gives **wisdom** (seeing the truth of non-satisfaction, impermanence, and non-self), Right Resolve gives **direction** — how one should think and live based on that wisdom.

A classic simile:

- **Right View** is like a map.
    
- **Right Resolve** is the decision of which way to go and why.

✨ In short:  
Right Resolve = intentions rooted in **renunciation, kindness, and compassion** instead of **craving, hatred, and cruelty**.

Connection of Right Resolve with the **three roots (wholesome/unwholesome)** so you can see how it works as an antidote to them?



Right Resolve (Sammā-saṅkappa) is the **second step of the Noble Eightfold Path**, right after Right View. It takes the understanding gained from Right View and turns it into a **direction of the heart and mind**—a commitment to live in a way that reduces non-satisfaction (dukkha) rather than increases it.

### Meaning

The word _saṅkappa_ means “thought,” “intention,” or “resolve.” It’s not just fleeting thought, but a deep **inner orientation**.

### The Three Parts of Right Resolve

According to the early texts, Right Resolve has three specific aspects:

1. **Resolve of Renunciation (Nekkhamma-saṅkappa)**
    
    - Turning away from craving and sensual clinging.
        
    - Instead of seeking happiness in constant grasping, one resolves to find freedom in letting go.
        
    - Example: choosing simplicity over endless consumption.
        
2. **Resolve of Non-Ill Will (Abyāpāda-saṅkappa)**
    
    - Replacing hostility, resentment, and anger with goodwill (mettā).
        
    - It’s the intention to meet others with kindness.
        
    - Example: instead of wishing harm to someone who hurt you, resolving to respond with understanding.
        
3. **Resolve of Non-Cruelty (Avihiṃsā-saṅkappa)**
    
    - Replacing harmfulness with compassion (karuṇā).
        
    - It’s the resolve to never exploit, injure, or be indifferent to others’ suffering.
        
    - Example: choosing not to profit at the expense of another’s well-being.
        

### Essence

Right Resolve is about **purifying intention**—moving from self-centered craving, anger, and harm toward detachment, goodwill, and compassion.

It creates the moral and mental ground for the next steps of the path (Right Speech, Action, and Livelihood).

✨ Aarya, if I connect this to the moneylender example we discussed earlier:

- **Labeling** (recognizing wholesome vs. unwholesome intentions) is like the clerk counting coins.
    
- **Experience** (direct knowing of the heart’s intention) is like the treasurer checking quality.
    
- **Clarity** (seeing deeply and guiding action) is like the moneylender making final judgments.
    

Right Resolve is like the **moneylender’s choice of which coins to accept and circulate**—a conscious turning of the heart toward renunciation, goodwill, and compassion.
