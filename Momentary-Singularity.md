## **Khanika Samadhi / MOMENTARY SINGULARITY**

 Use Mental “Noting” (Labeling) (Optional but Helpful)

  - Many vipassanā teachers recommend silently noting (labeling) :
    
  - “rising… falling” for the abdomen,
        
  - “touching” for contact,
        
        
  - This prevents distraction and builds quick, clear recognition (labeling)                           of each experience.
         
✨ **In short:**  
         
   Khaṇika samādhi develops when you maintain **continuous mindfulness of arising-and-passing phenomena**. 
   Each moment of collected attention is like a bead; many beads strung together form a necklace — that necklace is momentary concentration.     
   - “thinking… hearing… itching…” etc.
