Here are the 10 Fetters (samyojana) in Buddhism that bind beings to the cycle of rebirth (samsara):

         Sakkāya-diṭṭhi – Belief in a permanent self (personality view).

         Vicikicchā – Doubt, especially about the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha.

         Sīlabbataparāmāsa – Attachment to rites, rituals, or wrong practices.

         Kāma-rāga – Sensual desire or craving for sense pleasures.

         Vyāpāda – Ill will, aversion, or hatred.

         Rūpa-rāga – Craving for fine-material existence (form realm desire).

         Arūpa-rāga – Craving for immaterial or formless existence (formless realm                        desire).

         Māna/Ahamkara – Conceit, pride, or comparison with others.

         Uddhacca – Restlessness or agitation of mind.

         Avijjā – Ignorance, specifically not seeing reality as it is.

        The first three are called lower fetters, whose abandonment leads to stream-entry.

        The next four are higher fetters, progressively abandoned by once-returners and non-returners.

        The last three are subtle mental hindrances that bind even advanced practitioners until full awakening (arahantship).
