 Body (kāyānupassanā)

Mindfulness of breathing (ānāpāna):
Breathing in long → knows,
Breathing in short → knows,
Experiencing the whole body, calming the bodily formation.

Postures: walking, standing, sitting, lying down—aware of the posture.

Activities: eating, drinking, dressing, defecating, looking around—aware of what one is doing.

Elements: "This body is composed of the four great elements."

(Some early parallels include corpse contemplations, but these may have been added later, so the very earliest core may not have had them.)
