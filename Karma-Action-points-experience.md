The 5 bodily-experiences ends at each life but the mind-experiences goes from life to life.

Also two more experiences - Ahamkara - Afflicted experience
                    -    Storehouse experience (Alaya Vigyanaya)

Some schools say even the mind-experience doesn't travel from life to life but the ==Storehouse experience== do.

**Ālaya-vijñāna** literally means _“storehouse consciousness”_ or _“abode of experience.”_

Let’s explore the law of karma deeply, step by step, in a way that integrates both traditional Buddhist understanding and a practical view of how it affects life.

1. What Karma Is
Karma literally means “action” in Sanskrit. It refers not just to physical deeds, but also to words, thoughts, and intentions. The law of karma is a natural moral law of cause and effect:

Every intentional action produces a corresponding result.

These results may appear immediately, later in life, or even in future lives according to traditional Buddhist thought.

Key point: Not all actions produce the same weight of results—intent matters.

2. Types of Karma
Wholesome karma (kusala)

Actions motivated by non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion.

Example: Generosity, loving-kindness, clarity, and mindfulness.

Leads to positive results, like happiness, spiritual growth, and favorable circumstances.

Unwholesome karma (akusala)

Actions motivated by greed, hatred, or delusion.

Example: Lying, harming others, or indulging in selfish desires.

Leads to suffering, obstacles, or unfavorable circumstances.

Neutral karma

Actions that are unintentional or morally neutral.

Usually have minimal or no long-term karmic effect.

3. How Karma Works
Intention is primary: The Buddha said, “It is volition (cetana) that I call karma.”

It’s not just what you do, but why you do it that plants karmic seeds.

Karmic seeds:

Every action leaves an imprint in consciousness (similar to habits and heuristics in my framework).

These seeds ripen over time, producing experiences that correspond to the original action.

Ripening of karma:

Karmic results can be immediate, delayed, or latent, sometimes across lifetimes.

This explains why good or bad things happen even when the cause seems distant or hidden.

4. Karmic Patterns and Liberation
Karma is not fatalistic; it can be transformed:

Wholesome actions create positive momentum.

Mindfulness, insight, and ethical behavior can reduce the ripening of past unwholesome karma.

Awareness and understanding can stop new negative karmic imprints.

Ultimate goal in Buddhism: liberation from karma

When a person acts with perfect understanding and detachment, they stop creating new karmic seeds, leading to nirvana—freedom from the cycle of suffering.

5. Practical Implications
Every action matters: Even small intentions, thoughts, or words plant seeds.

Inner states shape outer life: Cultivating loving-kindness, clarity, and detachment reduces suffering.

Self-responsibility: You cannot escape the law of karma; your choices shape your reality.

Freedom through awareness: By recognizing cravings, aversions, and delusions, you can act in ways that end harmful cycles.

6. Analogy
Karma is like planting seeds in a garden:

Wholesome seeds → bloom into pleasant flowers

Unwholesome seeds → grow into weeds that entangle you

Awareness and effort → allow you to tend your garden skillfully, uproot weeds, and nurture flowers

Let me explain the **Law of Karma (kamma in Pāli, karma in Sanskrit)** in detail, from the Buddhist perspective.

---

## 1. Meaning of Karma

- **Karma literally means “action”** — but not all actions.
    
- It refers to **intentional actions** (cetanā). The Buddha said:
    
    > “It is volition, monks, that I call kamma.” (Aṅguttara Nikāya 6.63)
    

So karma is not just physical deeds, but also speech and thoughts, whenever they are driven by intention.

---

## 2. Types of Karma

### (a) By **channel**:

- **Bodily karma** (through physical deeds)
    
- **Verbal karma** (through speech)
    
- **Mental karma** (through thought and intention)
    

### (b) By **quality**:

- **Wholesome karma (kusala)**: arises from non-greed, non-hatred, clarity → leads to happiness, higher rebirths, liberation.
    
- **Unwholesome karma (akusala)**: arises from greed, hatred, confusion → leads to suffering, lower rebirths, more bondage.
    
- **Neutral karma**: actions without strong ethical weight (e.g., breathing, walking ordinarily).
    

### (c) By **time of result**:

- **Immediately effective** (visible in this life).
    
- **Next-life effective** (ripens at next rebirth).
    
- **Future-life effective** (ripens later, whenever conditions allow).
    

---

## 3. How Karma Works

- Karma is like a **seed**.
    
- The action (intention) plants the seed in the stream of mind.
    
- When conditions are right, the seed ripens as **vipāka** (result):
    
    - Happiness, suffering, rebirth, circumstances, tendencies.
        
- Not everything is karma — many things happen due to **physical laws, biological causes, other people’s actions, and environmental factors**. But karma is the moral thread that follows us life to life.
    

---

## 4. What Karma Is Not

- It is **not fate or predestination**. You can change future outcomes by new actions now.
    
- It is **not reward/punishment by a god**. It is an impersonal natural law, like gravity.
    
- It is **not every single event**. For example: if someone is struck by lightning, that is not necessarily due to past karma. But how they **respond** to it (with patience or hatred) creates karma.
    

---

## 5. Karma and Rebirth

- At death, the momentum of past karma influences where consciousness arises next (human, animal, heavenly, hell, etc.).
    
- But karma is not a “soul” traveling — it’s a causal continuity of habits and tendencies (like a flame lighting another flame).
    

---

## 6. Karma in Practice

- **Right View** means understanding karma correctly:
    
    - Good intentions → good results.
        
    - Bad intentions → bad results.
        
- By practicing the Eightfold Path, one stops creating unwholesome karma, cultivates wholesome karma, and ultimately transcends karma entirely (arahantship).
    

---

## 7. Deep Point

Even wholesome karma is still within **saṃsāra** (the cycle).

- Wholesome actions lead to good rebirths.
    
- But **only wisdom** (insight into impermanence, non satisfaction, not-self) ends the cycle by uprooting ignorance.
    
- Then one goes beyond karma — not making new seeds, and old seeds burn out.
    

---

✨ In short:

- **Karma = intentional action**.
    
- **Result (vipāka) = fruits of action when conditions allow**.
    
- It is a **law of cause and effect**, moral in nature, impersonal, inescapable until ignorance is uprooted.
